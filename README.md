ACF-SWEPs
=========

Conversion of XCF's SWEPs to standalone ACF-compatible format.

These SWEPs are configurable!
---------
Find all the options in 'lua\autorun\acf_swepconfig.lua'.  They're easy to change - have fun!

Huge thanks to Bubbus and everyone else working on ACF and XCF; both for creating something fantastic, and sharing it under the MIT License.
