# ACF-SWEPs

A much needed breath of life into [Bubbus' SWEPS](https://github.com/Bubbus/ACF-SWEPs) for [Armoured Combat Framework](https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF)

***

### These SWEPs are configurable!
You are completely free to make any changes you wish to the code here, there is however a configuration file located at 'lua\autorun\acf_swepconfig.lua'. It's easy to change and covers most of the global variables available. Enjoy!

***

### Notice:
Huge thanks to Bubbus and everyone else working on ACF and XCF; both for creating something fantastic, and being willing to share it under the MIT License.
